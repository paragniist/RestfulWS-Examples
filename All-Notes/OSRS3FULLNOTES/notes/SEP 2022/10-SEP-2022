Http = Hypertext transfer protocol, it is a protocol designed for exchanging the web/html markup over the network. HTTP protocol has been introduced with w3c org
initial version of http protocol is 1.0 and current version of http protocol: 2.0
	
In a http protocol there 2 types of messages are there
1. Request Message
2. Response Message

In case of a Request Message, as part of the headers it contains 3 main headers that differentiates from the Response.
1. protocol
2. uri
3. http method

in case of a Response Message we have always status code which differentiates the request from the response

Http Methods
There are 9 Http methods are there as part of Http 2.0 protocol standard
1. GET     = fetching the representation of the Resource from the server
2. POST    = creating an new Resource on the server
3. PUT     = updating an existing Resource on the server
4. DELETE  = deleting an existing resource on the server
5. HEAD    = head is similar to GET request only but in case of HEAD the response from the server will be returned by truncating the Response Body 
6. TRACE   = performs a message loop-back test along with the path of the resource
7. CONNECT = connect method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource
8. OPTIONS = used for retrieving the communication options with the target resource
9. PATCH   = to make partial update on the resource of the server 

In Restful Services we dont make use of all the Http methods, we model our restful services majorly on 4 http methods only which are 
1. GET
