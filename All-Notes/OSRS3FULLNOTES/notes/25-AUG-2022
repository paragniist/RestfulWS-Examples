The soap webservices are introduced to develop inter-operable distributed applications, soap is defined by its specification.
The soap specification has outlined/standardized set of standards
1. http = application protocol for exchanging data
2. xml = data interchange standard for exchanging the data between the programs in an inter-operable manner
3. soap = simple object access protocol for classification of information
4. wsdl = webservice description language for documentation
5. uddi registries = universal description discovery integration registries for distributing documentation to the world
that everyone should follow in building the software applications irrespective of language or platform to achieve inter-operability

But there are several problems in building applications based on soap-standards in acheiving inter-operability. 
most of the languages or enterprises are adopting soap standards in building applications to make them distributed and inter-operable since there is no alternate

Doctoral thesis: Architectural Styles and the design of network-based software architecture
Google: RESTIFIED


How does the Roy Fielding has approached to the doctoraial thesis:
There is no world wide web (WWW) initially, the notion of internet has been started from a school of graduates within their lab to the world today

1. How is the web so prevalent
2. what makes it so adoptable
3. how is it scalable

if we can identify the principles/rules over which world wide web is working, and adopt them in building out software applications then our applications also becomes successful, adoptable, scalable like world wide web.

1. Unique addressable URI
2. Uniform Constrained Interfaces
3. Communication Stateless
4. Representation Oriented
