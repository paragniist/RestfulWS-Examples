What is sub-resource locator, why do we need to use it?
We can group related set of resources under one-single resource class or an URI and dispatch the request to the sub-resources through it using sub-resource locator.
	
upon the jaxrs runtime receives the request, it identifies the request to an resource class, sub-resource locator method, now the sub-resource locator method returns the object of another sub-resource class, which contains resource methods inside it to the jaxrs runtime.
	
Now jaxrs runtimes maps the request to the resource method by looking into sub-resource class.
	
advantage:
1. we can group related resources together to dispatch the request
2. code is more organized and easily understandable
3. debugging the code becomes easy and encourages modularity

How many types of methods are there in a resource class?
We can write 3 types of methods within a resource class
1. resource method = if the method is annotated with http method designator annotations, then it is called "resource method"
2. sub-resource method = along with http method designator, it is associate with sub uri through @Path annotation, then it is called "sub-resource method"
3. sub-resource locator method = if the method is only annotated with @Path annotation that dispatches or returns the object of another resource-class to serve the request, then it is called "sub-resource locator method"
