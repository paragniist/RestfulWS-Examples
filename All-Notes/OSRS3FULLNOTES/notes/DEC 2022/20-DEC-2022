AsyncContext = That takes care of executing the logic in a separate thread of execution from the requestor thread and is responsible for dispatching the response back to the client using response-thread pool thread

As there are 2 different threads are being used for handling request/response we will not be blocked occuping the system resources and the scalability of the application will be good.
	
Note: we should use asynchronous server api or restful apis only when we have long-running process, if it is an short-lived process we dont need to use asynchronous programming apis because they dont add any benefit and on top of it, they make programming api complex

Asynchronous client api
The Asynchronous client api is no way in relationship with the Server/Resource implementation. Irrespective of the Resource is build on synchronous or asynchronous api, the client can be choosen to implement on its own.
	
There are 2 types of Asynchronous client apis are supported
1. Fork and Join
2. Callback
