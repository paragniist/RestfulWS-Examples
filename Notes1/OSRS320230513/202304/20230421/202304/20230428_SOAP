SOAP WebServices
SOAP stands for simple object access protocol, the support for developing soap webservices has been provided by sun microsystems to build interoperable, distributed applications aspart of the java language/platform

interoperable = The distributed component is accessible to the client applications, that are build using any language and are running on any platform, the these distributed components are called "interoperable"
	
by default every distributed component is not inter-operable, to achieve inter-operability among the vendors, we need common standards in building and exchanging the data between the applications

To establish common standards across the vendors, the WS-I organization has been established, WS-I is an opensource organization that is founded by all the players in the market to achieve common standards in making the applications interoperable. The WS-I organization has documented the common standards in specification documents
1. bp1.0
2. bp1.1
	
The sun microsystems has provided #2 apis based on the WS-I specifications to support building soap webservices in java language
1. bp1.0 = jaxrpc api (java api for xml remote procedure calls)
2. bp1.1 = jaxws api (java api for xml web services)
	
How does the architecture of SOAP Webservices looks like, what common standards are established in achieving inter-operability?
