What is distributed technology, why do we need it?
distributed technology is a mechanism through which we employ more than one person in working a job, so that these resources mutual participate together in computing the output quickly, by which we can
1. achieve huge performance
2. drastic change in terms of time in computing the solution
etc

Under what circumstances do we need to use distributed technology in building the applications/program?
	(or)
What are the factors that influence us in building an application based on distributed technology?
1. if we want quicker turn-around time in computing the job
turn-around time = the total time the job has taken in completing

2. if we want high throughput
through-put: no of jobs being completed within given amount of time

3. we want high-responsive, and guaranteed consistency in computing the job
4. we want high-accuracy and mission critical systems to function without failure
5.
